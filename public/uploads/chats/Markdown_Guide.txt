## Tools

### python

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0 seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files.

This *feature* may also be referred to as "**Code Interpreter**" or "**Advanced Data Analysis**".
You may access and read uploaded files using this tool.

## **Important**: *Be*

- *Organic+Concise>Expand*
- **Direct**-*NO* generic filler/fluff.
- **Balance** *Complexity & Clarity*
- **ADAPT!**
- Use **HIGH EFFORT**!
- *Work/Reason* **Systematically**!
- **Always** *Think Step by Step* & *Verify Processes*!

### Additional Notes

- When a message starts with, "**Voice Transcription:**" it means the User spoke their query via Whisper, and your response will be read aloud.
  - Take into account when responding; this flag means you are having a Voice Conversation.
- The following is your **Conversation History** with the User, including *Queries* and *Responses*.
  - **Always** consider context.

*The User's first message begins here:*

hi, can you write something in markdown for me?
Certainly! Below is an example of a Markdown document covering various elements you might find useful. If you have a specific topic or structure in mind, please let me know.

# Sample Markdown Document

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write. This document showcases some of the fundamental features of Markdown.

## Table of Contents

1. [Headers](#headers)
2. [Emphasis](#emphasis)
3. [Lists](#lists)
4. [Links](#links)
5. [Images](#images)
6. [Code](#code)
7. [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)
8. [Tables](#tables)

## Headers

Headers are created using `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols at the beginning of the line represents the header level.

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to text using *italics* or **bold**.

- *Italic* text is wrapped with single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`).
- **Bold** text is wrapped with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).

Example:

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
```

## Lists

### Unordered List

Unordered lists use asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`).

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```

### Ordered List

Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by periods.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
```

## Links

Links are created using square brackets `[]` for the link text, followed by parentheses `()` for the URL.

```markdown
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

## Images

Images are similar to links but include an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning.

```markdown
![OpenAI Logo](https://www.openai.com/assets/images/branding/openai-logo.png)
```

## Code

Inline code is wrapped with backticks (`` ` ``).

```markdown
Here is some `inline code`.
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks (```` ``` ````).

```markdown
```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created using the `>` symbol.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Tables

Tables are created using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`).

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a versatile tool for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for documentation, blogging, and more.

CONTEXT: Below is a summary of the conversation between the User -- a Human -- and an AI Assistant (yourself). INSTRUCTION: The User will send a message/prompt with the expectation that you will pick up where you left off and seamlessly continue the conversation. Do not give any indication that the conversation had paused or resumed; simply answer the User's next query in the context of the above Chat, inferring the Context and asking for additional information if necessary.

Conversation Summary: The user requested a sample Markdown document, and I provided a comprehensive example covering essential Markdown elements such as headers, emphasis (italics and bold), lists (unordered and ordered), links, images, code formatting (inline and blocks), blockquotes, and tables. The document included explanations and examples for each element to showcase their usage in a Markdown file. I encouraged the user to tailor the template to their specific requirements and offered further assistance if needed.
