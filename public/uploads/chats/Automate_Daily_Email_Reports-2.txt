User: <user_message> Write a script to automate sending daily email reports in Python, and walk me through how I would set it up step-by-step. V5 </user_message>

Assistant: 
I'll create a comprehensive Python script for automated daily email reports and provide detailed setup instructions. I'll break this down into multiple sections for clarity.

# 1. Script Overview
```python
import smtplib
import ssl
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import schedule
import time
import logging

class EmailReporter:
    def __init__(self, sender_email, sender_password, recipient_emails):
        """Initialize the EmailReporter with credentials and recipients."""
        self.sender_email = sender_email
        self.sender_password = sender_password
        self.recipient_emails = recipient_emails
        self.smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
        self.port = 587
        
        # Setup logging
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='email_reporter.log',
            level=logging.INFO,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
        )

    def generate_report(self):
        """Generate the report content - customize this method for your needs."""
        try:
            # Example: Reading data from a CSV file
            df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
            
            # Example report generation
            report_content = f"""
            Daily Report - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}
            
            Total Records: {len(df)}
            Average Value: {df['value_column'].mean():.2f}
            Maximum Value: {df['value_column'].max()}
            Minimum Value: {df['value_column'].min()}
            """
            
            return report_content
            
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error generating report: {str(e)}")
            return None

    def send_email(self):
        """Send the email with the generated report."""
        try:
            # Create message
            message = MIMEMultipart("alternative")
            message["Subject"] = f"Daily Report - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"
            message["From"] = self.sender_email
            message["To"] = ", ".join(self.recipient_emails)

            # Generate report content
            report_content = self.generate_report()
            if report_content is None:
                raise Exception("Failed to generate report content")

            # Attach report content
            part = MIMEText(report_content, "plain")
            message.attach(part)

            # Create secure SSL/TLS context
            context = ssl.create_default_context()

            # Send email
            with smtplib.SMTP(self.smtp_server, self.port) as server:
                server.starttls(context=context)
                server.login(self.sender_email, self.sender_password)
                server.send_message(message)

            logging.info("Email sent successfully")
            
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error sending email: {str(e)}")

def main():
    # Initialize EmailReporter
    reporter = EmailReporter(
        sender_email="your_email@gmail.com",
        sender_password="your_app_password",
        recipient_emails=["recipient1@email.com", "recipient2@email.com"]
    )

    # Schedule daily report
    schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(reporter.send_email)

    # Keep the script running
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(60)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# 2. Detailed Setup Instructions

## 2.1. Prerequisites Installation
```bash
pip install pandas schedule
```

## 2.2. Gmail Account Configuration
1. Enable 2-Step Verification:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification

2. Generate App Password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Generate and copy the 16-character password

## 2.3. Script Configuration Steps

1. Create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir daily_email_reports
cd daily_email_reports
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Create the main script file:
```bash
touch email_reporter.py
```

4. Copy the script above into email_reporter.py

5. Modify the following variables in the main() function:
   - sender_email: Your Gmail address
   - sender_password: Your generated app password
   - recipient_emails: List of email recipients

6. Customize the generate_report() method to match your data source and reporting needs

## 2.4. Running the Script

1. Test run:
```bash
python email_reporter.py
```

2. Setting up as a system service (Linux):

Create a systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/email-reporter.service
```

Add the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Daily Email Reporter
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/daily_email_reports
ExecStart=/path/to/daily_email_reports/venv/bin/python email_reporter.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable email-reporter
sudo systemctl start email-reporter
```

# 3. Customization Options

## 3.1. Report Content
Modify the generate_report() method to include your specific data sources and calculations:
- Read from databases using SQLAlchemy
- Process Excel files using pandas
- Generate graphs using matplotlib
- Include HTML formatting for rich email content

## 3.2. Scheduling Options
Modify the schedule timing in main():
```python
# Examples:
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(reporter.send_email)  # Daily at 9 AM
schedule.every().monday.at("07:00").do(reporter.send_email)  # Mondays at 7 AM
schedule.every().hour.do(reporter.send_email)  # Every hour
```

## 3.3. Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling and logging. You can enhance it by:
- Adding retry mechanisms
- Implementing backup SMTP servers
- Setting up error notifications
- Configuring more detailed logging

# 4. Maintenance and Monitoring

1. Check the log file regularly:
```bash
tail -f email_reporter.log
```

2. Monitor system service status:
```bash
systemctl status email-reporter
```

3. Regular maintenance tasks:
- Review and rotate log files
- Update dependencies
- Check SMTP server settings
- Monitor disk space for logs and data files

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the script in more detail or help you customize it for your specific needs?
